            <h3>Welcome to my page!</h3>
            <p>Hi! My name is Maaria Wahlström, I live in Vantaa, Finland and I intend to become a professional programmer.
                My plan is to learn to code, then code some cool things, then get a job where I can learn more coding and make 
                more cool things.  </p>
            <h3>My coding experience</h3>
            <p>My first foray into programming was a language technology course where we learned to use <strong>Python</strong> as 
                a tool for analyzing text samples. I loved the puzzle-like nature of the excercises - tweaking the code until you 
                get the desired result. I felt the same drive when learning to use <strong>R</strong> in statistical analysis on a 
                psychometrics course. I decided to follow this passion and started my programming studies in July 2019. Since then I've 
                learned the basics of <strong>Java</strong>, <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>JavaScript</strong>, <strong>SQL</strong>, 
                <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong> and <strong>Git</strong>. I've also gotten practice with Maven, Gradle and Flask, 
                as well as delved into testing with JUnit, unittest and Robot Framework. 
                A year ago I made my first independent project, a calendar app with Java, while learning the basics 
                of the software engineering process. I'm doing the next course on that series now, expanding that knowledge. More on my 
                ongoing courses below.</p>
            <p>Here's what I've studied, first in Open University and now as a student in University of Helsinki's Department of Computer Science:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h4>Full stack web development (ongoing)</h4>
                    <p>Learning web development with JavaScript by building single-page apps with React, supported by REST-apis with Node.js.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Software engineering (Ohjelmistotuotanto, ongoing)</h4>
                    <p>Basics of the management, phases and tools of software development projects.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Data structures project</h4>
                    <p>I'm going to build a <a href="https://github.com/maariaw/minesweeper-helper">helper bot for solving minesweeper</a> with Java.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Software development methods</h4>
                    <p>I'm building a little <a href="https://github.com/maariaw/ot-harjoitustyo">calendar app</a> with Java as a course project and learning more about testing, documentation and code style.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Computer Fundamentals I & II</h4>
                    <p>I'm learning the basics of how computer hardware works.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Computing tools for CS studies</h4>
                    <p>I learned the basics of working with Ubuntu on WSL, using Git and GitHub and making a static web page (this one!). Waiting on next opportunity to take the exam.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Datastructures and algorithms</h4>
                    <p>I learned to construct datastructures like hash tables, heaps and graphs and to code basic algorithms for them on Java. The course is notoriously difficult but I enjoyed the challenge and worked hard to complete all excercises.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Introduction to databases</h4>
                    <p>I learned the basics of SQL and made a small database managing program on Java.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Advanced course in programming</h4>
                    <p>I learned more about Java, such as how to use interfaces, make a gui and add multimedia to a program.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Introduction to programming</h4>
                    <p>I learned the basics of object oriented programming and unit testing with Java.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>More about me</h3>
            <p>I have a bachelor's degree in psychology. I speak Finnish, English, Swedish and a little bit of Japanese and French. 
                I like cute platformer, simulation and puzzle games. I often listen to audiobooks while traveling or doing chores.
