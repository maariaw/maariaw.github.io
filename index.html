            <h3>Welcome to my page!</h3>
            <p>Hi! My name is Maaria Wahlström, I live in Helsinki, Finland and I intend to become a professional programmer. 
                My plan is to learn to code, then code some cool things, then get a job where I can learn more coding and make 
                more cool things.  </p>
            <h3>My coding experience</h3>
            <p>My first foray into programming was a language technology course where we learned to use <strong>Python</strong> as 
                a tool for analyzing text samples. I loved the puzzle-like nature of the excercises - tweaking the code until you 
                get the desired result. I felt the same drive when learning to use <strong>R</strong> in statistical analysis on a 
                psychometrics course. I decided to follow this passion and started my programming studies in July 2019. Since then I've 
                learned the basics of <strong>Java</strong>, <strong>SQL</strong>, <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong> and 
                <strong>Git</strong>. Right now I'm brushing off my Python and getting into JavaScript.</p>
            <p>Most of my studies consist of Open University courses offered by University of Helsinki's Department of Computer Science:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h4>Computing tools for CS studies (Pending...)</h4>
                    <p>I learned the basics of working with Ubuntu on WSL, using Git and GitHub and making a static web page (this one!). Waiting on next opportunity to take the exam.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Datastructures and algorithms</h4>
                    <p>I learned to construct datastructures like hash tables, heaps and graphs and to code basic algorithms for them on Java. The course is notoriously difficult but I enjoyed the challenge and worked hard to complete all excercises.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Introduction to databases</h4>
                    <p>I learned the basics of SQL and made a small database managing program on Java.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Advanced course in programming</h4>
                    <p>I learned more about Java, such as how to use interfaces, make a gui and add multimedia to a program.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Introduction to programming</h4>
                    <p>I learned the basics of object oriented programming and unit testing with Java.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>More about me</h3>
            <p>I have a bachelor's degree in psychology. I speak Finnish, English, Swedish and a little bit of Japanese and French. 
                I like cute platformer, simulation and puzzle games. I often listen to audiobooks while traveling or doing chores.
