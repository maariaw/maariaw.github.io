            <h3>Welcome to my page!</h3>
            <p>
                Hi! My name is Maaria Wahlström, I live in Vantaa, Finland and I intend to become a professional programmer.
                My plan is to learn to code, then code some cool things, then get a job where I can learn more coding and make
                more cool things.
            </p>
            <h3>My coding experience</h3>
            <p> 
                My first foray into programming was a language technology course where we learned to use <strong>Python</strong> as
                a tool for analyzing text samples. I loved the puzzle-like nature of the exercises - tweaking the code until you
                get the desired result. I felt the same drive when learning to use <strong>R</strong> in statistical analysis on a
                psychometrics course. I decided to follow this passion and started my programming studies in July 2019.
            </p>
            <p> 
                Since then I've done projects with <strong>Java</strong>, using <strong>Maven</strong> or <strong>Gradle</strong> for
                dependency management, and more recently with Python using <strong>Poetry</strong>. I've had quite a bit of practice with
                <strong>Git</strong> and all my projects can be found in <strong>GitHub</strong>, some of which also have <strong>GitHub Actions</strong>
                facilitating <strong>continuous integration</strong>. I've also learned the basics of <strong>SQL</strong>, and used a
                <strong>PostgreSQL</strong> database with a couple of <strong>Heroku</strong> apps. Other technologies that I've dabbled with
                are <strong>Flask</strong>, <strong>JavaScript</strong>, <strong>NodeJS</strong> and <strong>React</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Most of my projects have been individual works, but at the end of 2021 I got to participate in a group project. The
                <a href="https://tolkien-lukuvinkkikirjasto.herokuapp.com/">web app</a> we made together was very small, but the emphasis was on
                learning the process of software engineering as a team, and implementing <strong>Scrum</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here's what I've studied, first in Open University and now as a student in University of Helsinki's Department of Computer Science:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h4>Full stack web development (ongoing)</h4>
                    <p>I'm learning web development with JavaScript by building single-page apps with React, supported by REST-apis with Node.js.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Software engineering (Ohjelmistotuotanto)</h4>
                    <p>I learned the basics of management, phases and tools of software development projects. Included a <a href="https://github.com/tugee/ohtu-miniprojekti">"mini-project"</a> done in a group of 6, learning a bit of Scrum in practice</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Data structures project</h4>
                    <p>I built a <a href="https://github.com/maariaw/minesweeper-helper">helper bot for solving minesweeper</a> with Java.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Software development methods</h4>
                    <p>I built a little <a href="https://github.com/maariaw/ot-harjoitustyo">calendar app</a> with Java as a course project and learned more about testing, documentation and code style.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Computer Fundamentals I & II</h4>
                    <p>I learned the basics of how computer hardware works.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Computing tools for CS studies</h4>
                    <p>I learned the basics of working with Ubuntu on WSL, using Git and GitHub and making a static web page (this one!).</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Datastructures and algorithms</h4>
                    <p>I learned to construct datastructures like hash tables, heaps and graphs and to code basic algorithms for them on Java. The course is notoriously difficult but I enjoyed the challenge and worked hard to complete all exercises.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Introduction to databases</h4>
                    <p>I learned the basics of SQL and made a small database managing program on Java.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Advanced course in programming</h4>
                    <p>I learned more about Java, such as how to use interfaces, make a gui and add multimedia to a program.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Introduction to programming</h4>
                    <p>I learned the basics of object oriented programming and unit testing with Java.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>More about me</h3>
            <p>I have a bachelor's degree in psychology. I speak Finnish, English, Swedish and a little bit of Japanese and French. 
                I like cute platformer, simulation and puzzle games. I often listen to audiobooks while traveling or doing chores.
